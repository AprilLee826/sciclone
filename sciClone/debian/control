Description: An R package for inferring the subclonal architecture of tumors
 The cloneCaller R package integrates the read depth and copy number information at single nucleotide variant locations in order to create a visualization of the sub-clonal variant populations areas of deleted, neutral, and amplified copy number. Variants are optionally clustered to formalize predictions of the sub-clonal makeup of the sample.
